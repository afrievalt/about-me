### Why are you looking for a new opportunity?

After enjoying a fulfilling 30-year career, I recently encountered a new experience: being part of a Reduction In Force (RIF). I consider myself fortunate that it took this long for such an occurrence to arise.

### What are you looking for in your next opportunity?

I would like to utilize my expertise in react to deliver value. I love building applications with the end user in mind. I also enjoy building component library's. I love mentoring other developers and watching them grow.

### What did you do at your last 2 companies?

As a Front End Technical Lead, I was responsible for improving the over all quality of the front end software systems and level up the developers around me. I achieved this by conducting thorough design and code reviews, documenting best practices, documenting code review standards, and one on one mentoring. As a result of my effort, features were able to be derived faster by more developers and with higher quality.  

I also architected and implemented the component library adhering to our design system. This component library was used by multiple team and helped deliver a more consistent look and feel.

As needed, I was an individual contributor to [Service Channel Managed](https://www.linkedin.com/products/servicechannel-managed/).

#### Lead tiger team.
We traveled to our Seattle office to design an add-on to Posting+. Working closely with that office, we were able to rapidly breakdown a complex and confusing process. After building different workflows, we were able to respond to feedback and quickly deliver a solution. New FRs now require less training and have less compliance issues increasing FR retention. All FRs are able to service more clients by spending less time on paper work.
 
In just two months more than 700 representatives discontinued the dictation service. This feature alone resulted in $38,000 a month in savings.

More coming soon....

Andy's approach to this project was truly impressive, as he not only created high-quality components but also conducted extensive research on usability, actively sought out feedback from other developers and designers, and thoroughly tested and documented his work.

What sets Andy apart is his ability to consistently bring fresh ideas and new insights to the table, no matter how complex or simple the component was. His dedication to staying up-to-date with the latest trends and techniques in design and development is truly inspiring, and it's clear that he is always striving to improve his craft.

Overall, I would highly recommend Andy to any team looking for a talented and dedicated developer.
