# This repository holds information about me targeted to future employers.   

### Why are you looking for a new opportunity?
After enjoying a fulfilling 30-year career, I recently encountered a new experience: being part of a Reduction In Force (RIF). I consider myself fortunate that it took this long for such an occurrence to arise.  

### What are you looking for in your next opportunity? 
I would like to utilize my expertise in react to deliver value.  I love building applications with the end user in mind.  I also enjoy building component library's.  I love mentoring other developers and watching them grow.  

### What did you do at your last position?

As a Front End Technical Lead, I was responsible for improving the over all quality of the front end software systems and level up the developers around me.  I achieved this by conducting thorough design and code reviews, documenting best practices, documenting code review standards, and one on one mentoring.  As a result of my effort, features were able to be derived faster by more developers and with higher quality.  

I also architected and implemented the component library adhering to our design system.  This component library was used by multiple team and helped deliver a more consistent look and feel.
