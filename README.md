### Why are you looking for a new opportunity?

After enjoying a fulfilling 30-year career, I recently encountered a new experience: being part of a Reduction In Force (RIF). I consider myself fortunate that it took this long for such an occurrence to arise.

### What are you looking for in your next opportunity?

I would like to utilize my expertise in react to deliver value. I love building applications with the end user in mind. I also enjoy building component library's. I love mentoring other developers and watching them grow.

### What did you do at your last 2 companies?

In my role as a Front End Technical Lead, I took charge of enhancing the overall quality of our front-end software systems and elevating the skills of fellow developers. I accomplished this through rigorous design and code reviews, documenting best practices, and the formulation of code review standards. Additionally, I provided one-on-one mentoring to team members. As a result of these efforts, we witnessed accelerated feature development, better software performance, all while maintaining a high standard of quality and reduction in tech-debt.

Furthermore, I spearheaded the design and implementation of a component library in line with our design system. This library found utility across multiple teams, contributing to a more consistent and cohesive user interface experience.

As needed, I was also an individual contributor to [Service Channel Managed](https://www.linkedin.com/products/servicechannel-managed/).

I spearheaded the development of Northwestern Mutual's mobile application.  Posting+ helped Financial Representatives (FR) call clients and easily track activity in the CRM.  One of the challenges of the project was the Siebel CRM was getting replaced with Microsoft Dynamics CRM.  I architected the frontend in such a way the we could seamlessly replace the backend.

One of the rewarding aspects of this project was the ongoing engagement with stakeholders. We actively sought and incorporated their feedback from the start of the project.  This allowed us to swiftly adapt and fine-tune the software, making it not only functional but also enjoyable.  

Here is some user feedback I received:

* I can now make 12 calls in the time it took to make 4.
* I've never heard the word intuitive used to describe software built here.
 Wow, this is great. You've eliminated all our excuses for not phoning. 

What is your leadership experience?

The majority of my leadership experience centers around the realm of technology. This entails making critical decisions regarding the selection of tools, libraries, frameworks, as well as overseeing and facilitating code and design reviews. In addition, I've been heavily involved in mentoring and guiding developers, as well as documenting processes and best practices.

Another significant aspect of my leadership journey involves nurturing and enhancing the skills of fellow professionals through mentoring and the establishment of structured learning paths.

Furthermore, I have played a pivotal role in the assessment of technical talent for hiring purposes and conducting performance evaluations.

While I haven't managed direct reports, my approach to leadership has been largely informal due to my extensive experience as a contractor. Nevertheless, even in these capacities, I have held leadership positions such as scrum master, team lead, and was entrusted with spearheading Northwestern Mutual's inaugural tiger team initiative.

Tiger teams are collaborative units that pair application development teams with Northwestern Mutual financial representatives nationwide to pinpoint areas where digital solutions can create value. Subsequently, these teams embark on expedited development exercises to create, test, refine, and deliver functional solutions.

I assembled a hand-picked team that journeyed to our Seattle office to devise an add-on for Posting+. Our close collaboration with the Seattle office enabled us to deconstruct a complex and convoluted process rapidly. By developing various workflows and actively incorporating feedback, we swiftly delivered a streamlined solution. This resulted in reduced training requirements for new financial representatives and a decrease in compliance issues, ultimately boosting retention rates. Additionally, all financial representatives could serve more clients with reduced paperwork, leading to substantial cost savings of over $32,000,000 and earning Northwestern Mutual the prestigious [Eye on Innovation Award](https://news.northwesternmutual.com/2016-10-19-Northwestern-Mutual-Honored-by-Gartner-with-Eye-on-Innovation-Prize).
